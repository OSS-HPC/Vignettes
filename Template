Here is what should be addressed in a vignette:

- What does this software do?
- What is the license?
- BRIEF history of the project, including funding sources?
- Are there commercial derivatives?  What form do they take?  Are companies making money off of derivative works?
- Are there commercial packages that depend on or otherwise make use of this?
- Are there companies using this package to develop new technology of any kind?  Please give specific examples if possible.
- Are there closed-source competitors or alternatives to this?  Please compare and contrast this OSS to these on all relevant axes.
